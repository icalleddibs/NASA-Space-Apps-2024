## Description
OrbitWatch is an interactive web-based orrery created to educate future aerospace designers on the most pressing issues in heliophysics and space exploration. The project was submitted under the challenge titled **Create an Orrery Web App that Displays Near-Earth Objects**; objectives can be found on the [NASA Space Apps 2024 Challenge Home Page](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/create-an-orrery-web-app-that-displays-near-earth-objects/?tab=details). The entire project was developed in less than 36 hours in-person at the Centennial College Downsview Campus for Aerospace and Innovation.
*OrbitWatch was awarded a Local Event Winner out of 300+ Toronto teams, and a Global Nominee as one of 940 teams selected from over 99,000 participants, making it the largest international hackathon ever.*

The webapp introduces a visualization tool highlighting the relative motion of solar and asteroid events, as well as their impacts on Earth and its satellites. There is an emphasis on mapping satellite activity, space debris, and solar wind to demonstrate how the increasing number of communications constellations and Earth orbiters can be affected by the presence of solar activity. The orreries are completely interactive, featuring 360° navigation and real-time data.

There are two orreries on the webapp: one for the solar system, and a close-up of the Earth and its 3 tiers of satellites. Each page provides additional and toggleable information about the objects on the screen, made possible by clicking and interacting with its components. The Earth close-up includes live satellite tracking with real-time animation using open-source data from the non-profit Celestrak. The solar orrery has been sped up to show relative orbits around the sun. Solar wind data was interpolated from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center in an attempt to visualize solar activity.

## Tools and Technical Components
All individual code integrated into the webapp can be found within this repository: `NASA-Space-Apps-2024/threePractice/testproject`.
This was every team member's first time using Three.js and doing 3D modelling. We utilized the skills from our backgrounds as student engineers and scientists to quickly learn and develop a functional prototype.
- WebApp frame work and integration platfom with JavaScript
- Visualization and interactive elements with HTML and CSS
- 3D modeling with Three.js
- Website deployment on GitHub and Netlify
- Orbitals and trajectories manually derived from celestial positioning through astrophysics

## Acknowledgement
The OrbitWatch team would like to thank the organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and industry mentors of NASA Space Apps Toronto for fostering a welcoming community and providing us with the chance to participate in an invaluable weekend of hands-on activity. We are grateful to have been recognized as Local Winners and Global Nominees for our efforts in innovation and scientific representation.
